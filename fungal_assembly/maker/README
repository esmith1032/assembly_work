A few notes:

There are two modules on biocluster with the name snap.
One is a read-mapping program (snap) and the other is the gene prediction program we need (SNAP).
MAKE SURE TO LOAD THE CORRECT ONE (the one in all caps).

The three files with .ctl extensions are required to be in the current working directory for MAKER to run appropriately.
These can be created using the command: maker CTL

The above command will populate all of the paths in the maker_exe.ctl file, provided all of the required modules are loaded when the command is run.
Otherwise, these can be populated manually.

The maker_opts.ctl file has many options for inputting different sources of information for gene model validation.
The ones I used were:

genome=path/to/genome/file (required)
organism_type=eukaryotic (required)
altest=path/to/alternate/est/data (I used EST [or RNAseq] data from a closely related organism)
protein=path/to/protein/fasta (I concatenated all published proteome fastas from species in the same genus)
snaphmm=path/to/snap/hmm/file (I used the minimal.hmm available on the snap website)
gmhmm=path/to/genemark/hmm (I had previously created a genemark hmm file from this genome for genemark self-training [I will update with that script])
augustus_species=species_name (I picked the most closely related species I could find. These files are located in the augustus package directory [/opt/linux/centos/7.x/x86_64/pkgs/augustus/3.1/config/species])
