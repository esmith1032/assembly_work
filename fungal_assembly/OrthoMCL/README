OrthoMCL requires a MySQL database. Contact the system administrator to get this set up.

OrthoMCL also requires that the .fasta files for all species are formatted so that the defline for each protein is in the format >XXXX|YYYY where XXXX is a 3-4 letter taxon/species identification and YYYY is a gene id that is unique within that taxon/species (i.e. two proteins in the same fasta file can't both be 0001). I wrote my own script to do this (format_fastas_orthomcl.pl), but there is also an orthomclFormatFasta script that does this, though the input fasta for that script must also have a specific format.

OrthoMCL also requires that you run an all-v-all BLAST of all proteins in your data set. The makeblastdb and blastp commands perform that BLAST.

There is also a requirement that there be an orthomcl.config file in the current working directory so that OrthoMCL can talk to the MySQL databse.
